## [0.3.0] - 2020-10-13
### Changed (breaks everything)
- Full reimplementation with different API and dependencies.
- A single `rsg` program is used to start the RSG server,
  to add initial actors in the simulation, and to start/stop the simulation.
  Details in `rsg --help`.
- `librsg`'s API should now be very close to SimGrid's s4u API, with some changes:
  - Functions to send data (to put data in mailboxes) really transfer data here,
    so another argument is required (the data size).
  - Additional functions are provided for a smoother integration in studied apps â€”
    e.g., to wrap thread or process creation.
- Dependencies are now:
  - [protobuf][protobuf] to serialize messages between RSG processes.
  - docopt for CLI convenience.
  - boost lockfree, used for shared memory communication in the RSG server.
  - SimGrid (of course).

## [0.2.0] - 2018-07-20
### Added
- *rsg_server* can now be used with the `--background` flag, which executes
  the server in background and terminates immediately.
- *rsg_server* can now be used with the `--server-only` flag, which prevents
  the automatic execution of the clients.
  In this case, the user is expected to execute the clients.
- *rsg_server*'s CLI now has options (and no longer has positional arguments).
- Servers are now launched in parallel.  
  Previously, clients needed to connect in a sequential fashion to rsg_server.
- *rsg_server* now runs a status service, which notably allows to retrieve
  information about the current client connections.  
  Requests are formatted in plain text and follow the common ZeroMQ
  request-reply pattern.
  Current supported requests are `status all` and `status waiting_init`.  
  This service uses TCP, and is bound on port 4242 by default.
  Port can be changed via *rsg_server*'s command-line option `--status-port`.

### Changed
- Dependencies :
  - Thrift: 0.11.0 is now required (previously, 0.9.3 or 0.10.0 was required).
  - Boost.Program_options is now required.
